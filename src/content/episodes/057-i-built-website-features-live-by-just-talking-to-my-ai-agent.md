## Show Notes

In this episode of The Web Talk Show, Armando Perez-Carreno builds website features live on stream using an AI coding agent. No IDE, no manual code edits. Just plain English instructions sent via Telegram.

He demonstrates real-time updates to **Mom's Guide SA**, a local directory for family-friendly events and places in San Antonio, including removing UI elements, adjusting layouts, and adding interactive features — all while talking to the audience.

## Topics Covered

- **How AI coding agents like OpenClaw work** and why they're different from chat-based LLMs
- **Live demo** of sending natural language instructions and seeing instant results on a preview site
- **Why custom software for small businesses** can now be built in days instead of months
- **How field workers can use WhatsApp, Telegram, or voice** to interact with AI agents on the job
- **The shift from fitting your business into SaaS tools** to building tools that fit your business

If you run a small business and have ever wished you could just tell someone what to build and have it done — this episode is for you.
