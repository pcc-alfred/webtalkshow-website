  Hello everyone and welcome to the web talk show. My name is Arno Po and today we're talking about using AI in auto repair shops. This is going to be a fun topic and today we're also streaming in a new platform. You can probably see some Christmas trees and decorations around here. This is Streamlabs. I hadn't specifically used Streamlabs myself, so we're going to see what this looks like. Please, if you're watching, just let me know if you're watching live, of course. Let me know if you can hear me. Uh, we should be live on X. 
  
  We should be live on YouTube. We should be It looks like we are live. Okay, perfect. On YouTube, we should be live on LinkedIn as well. I have to check that one still. Let's look at that. Looks like we are. And then on the Facebook page also. Yes, it looks like it is. Wow, it's going super fast. Okay, there we are. So, I think we're here. Anyway, if you're here, please say hi. Drop by. Say hi. Here we are. I'm going to see if the chat feature works as well. I haven't used this particular tool. 
  
  I was talking with my Carlo earlier today. We were discussing Reream, Riverside, all sorts of different tools, and the topic of Streamlabs came up. I had seen Streamlabs a while back. It's sort of a fork from OBS, but it has additional features. And I thought of it more of as a Twitch gaming streamer kind of tool. I didn't really consider it until Mike said it also has the possibility for having guests on. So, this is good since I typically have guests for the web talk show, the podcast itself, then this might be a good tool. 
  
  
  
  **[00:02:00]**
  
  and it has this feature that I didn't know about called Talk Studio, which is what I'm using right now, which allows you to do sort of this setup live instead of opening the application and doing it from there. You can just do it from the browser, which is pretty neat for these types of scenarios. The reason I wanted to test it right now is to see if it would actually stream properly to all the different platforms. In this case, I think we're doing, like I said, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube at the same time. Let's see if it works out nicely. So, please drop any comments, questions that you might have in the chat and we'll see if they come up here. If even if you just want to say hi, that works well as well. Coming into the holiday season, it's going to be a great week. I hope it's a great week for you. And the topic of today is voice AI assistance and shop assistance as well for a an auto repair shop. And this doesn't have to be specifically for an auto repair shop. Anything sort of adjacent will make sense to you as well. 
  
  if it's relating to cars or shops for that matter. Um, there's so much that we can do with these agents nowadays that will save you so much time. Now, why am I choosing autoshop specifically to talk about today? Well, my dad has had an autoshop for many, many years. And so, we've seen the inside and out of the business. And one of the things that comes up in a lot of auto repair shops and similar businesses is that you usually have one or two receptionists that can take visitors coming in walk-ins 
  
  **[00:04:00]**
  
  and they can also take calls and they're also doing a lot of other things. They might be doing billing, they might be doing data capture, they might be helping you with other things around the office. Now, if that person is answering the phone, they cannot do the other thing. If someone walks in, they cannot answer the phone. So, what can help in a situation like this one is a voice AI receptionist. We've talked about this in the past. This is not an IVR. It's not a voice answering service like the one you call into and it tells you press one for sales and press two for support or press three for pricing. This is completely different. If you've ever used ChatGpt's voice tool where you you open the little voice tool and you start talking to it and it feels like you're talking to a person and it gives you replies, etc. It's like that. It feels like that. You call into a number and it responds. It takes a call and it just feels like a normal person. It you can choose all sorts of voices. It could be male. It could be female. 
  
  It could be young, old, happy, sad, mellow, slow, excited, engaging. You can do whatever you want with the voices. There's many different platforms for voices as well, and I'll get into some of the details as well, so you know what things fit into the mix. But just imagine it's like talking to a real person. The benefit of this is that that real person is actually many different people because you can have it take 15 20 calls at the same time and be answering the questions from everyone at the same time. And that's where the real 
  
  **[00:06:00]**
  
  power lies because it's not just a pre-baked question answer flow which I'm sure you've experienced before where you call and it's sort of a an agent of sorts but you ask it something and then it says could you repeat the question I don't I didn't understand or I didn't find it in my knowledge base. If you've had that experience is typically because it's not an actual LLM behind the scenes. It's just a series of condition paths and it has a few questions that it can answer and the rest it can not do much with it. 
  
  This is completely different. 
  
  This has an LLM behind the scenes which means that it will understand natural language. So depending on how we prompt it, depending on the instructions that we give it, it can answer any question that your customers could have. So if a customer calls in and they want to know which services you offer, they could just say, "Hello, what services do you offer?" And then the the AI will respond, "Well, what are you looking for?" Or it could actually respond with a list of services. Or it could ask them about their car. 
  
  It could say, "What make and model is your vehicle?" And then the person would say, "Oh, it's a Honda Civic. Um, I think it's like a 2006, I'm not sure, twodoor, something." Then the agent can take that, interpret it, and immediately respond, "Oh, perfect. 2006 Honda Civic. Is it a twodoor or a four-door?" And then the person could say, "Oh, it's a four-door. Okay, perfect. Do you know if it's EXL, EXS, I don't know, whatever. SIR and it can it can have a knowledge base of possibilities to then get deeper into what the actual person's 
  
  **[00:08:00]**
  
  vehicle is instead of just being generic. And so then it can offer specific services that might help that particular person with their car. So instead of telling them, "Oh yeah, we do engine reconstructions and we can change the block and we can do whatever." If it's a new car, they're most likely just interested in things like an oil change or brake fluid check or something that is applicable for their type of vehicle. So instead of just telling everything, it could be very specific. So that's again where it gets really powerful because it's just like having a regular conversation that you would have with the receptionist of a front-end staff. Now I have to make something very clear because sometimes people get scared and think, "Oh, this is going to replace the receptionist." No, it's not. Trust me, they're not going anywhere. This is something to support your receptionist or your front desk staff. You have your staff there. They do an excellent job, but sometimes they are overworked. Sometimes they just have too many things to do and they cannot do everything at once. So this comes in as a tool that allows them to have some of the work taken off their plate so they can focus on more important work. For instance, if someone is calling in just to check your hours, regardless, they're still taking up the time of your regular front desk staff. So if the AI receptionist can be taking all those calls let's say five calls come in at the same time asking about times about pricing about the types of services that you offer all those people would have taken your staff's time but then also it would have delayed the answer for all the other people waiting 
  
  **[00:10:00]**
  
  in line. 
  
  Then if this can take all these calls, then your staff can assist people with actual problems. Maybe they have a specific issue that they need to resolve about their vehicle. Maybe they have to check on the status of their vehicle and or something different. In that scenario, your front-end staff can handle that request. And even if your front desk staff is busy, then you can also connect the voice AI receptionist to your internal tooling such that someone could say, "Oh, just wanted to check on the status of my vehicle. Do you know if it's ready?" Then the AI agent would ask, "Sure, what's your license plate and last name?" And then some way you want to verify they're actually them. Once they provide that information, same as they would do with your regular staff. Then the agent can go in check your system and then come back and say, "Oh yeah, it's they're working on it in basics. They have they've been working on it for 15 minutes. They have 3 minutes to go according to our timeline. You should be able to come pick it up at 3 p.m. or something like that." So again, another call that your staff didn't have to take, so they can focus on other things. One of the great things about this is that we sometimes call in as a customer and we want to know something like that, but we have to wait for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes because the lines are busy. And in this scenario, we get an instant response for what we need. So, as a customer, it's a much better experience because we get what we want. And again, this is something that I see constantly being brought up 
  
  **[00:12:00]**
  
  where people say, "No, I don't want an AI to answer the call. I want a human. Well, yes. If you want a human, there can't be enough humans answering all the calls. So, if you want a human, you're going to have to wait. And then that human might be actually in a bad mood because they've been talking all day and getting complaints. Whereas, if there's an AI assistant in that office, in that shop, then you can call in. It will greet you happily regardless of what your attitude is and regardless of what has happened throughout the day and it will give you the answer to your query which is what you want. You don't want to call in to talk to someone. I mean that's not what auto shop is for. You want to get a response about the service for your vehicle or the status on your vehicle or how much the price is or anything of that nature. They are very very useful. Now some things that you can have it do is you can train it on the different services that you have prices. You can even trade it on discounts that you may be running specifically on that season. Right now it's the holiday season. So maybe you have some special discounts you can promote over there via the call. You could if you connect to the system have it check the status of the vehicle. You could have it check if a specific part has arrived for that person. Maybe they were waiting for a part. They just want to call in. They just want to see, hey, has the part arrived? Are we still waiting? Are we months away or weeks away or just a day away? Or maybe 
  
  **[00:14:00]**
  
  they just want to call in for billing. Maybe they have a question about their balance due and they want to make a payment. They don't want to wait in the queue for a call just to see how much they have to pay. They're trying to pay you and and you keep them on hold. So again, something like this can really help out both your customers and also your staff, your employees. So if if you've ever had an experience calling into, and this could be for an autoshop or anything else, let me know in the chat. 
  
  Just if you've ever called in somewhere and you've had to be put on hold because someone hasn't answered, let me know in the chat if if anything like that has ever happened to you. It happened to me all the time. I've just like you call somewhere. Sometimes we don't even want to call like the doctor's office, the dentist. You you call and you know you're just gonna be there on hold. You even just even before you start, you put the phone on speaker, you put it next to you, try to do something else. You're listening to the hold music for half an hour until they get your call and then eventually maybe someone answers and let's hope they're in a good mood to to answer your query. So yeah, it's not it's not ideal. I think the way it's handled now. So I think voice AI receptionists are really going to come in and sort this out for a lot of different servicebased businesses. Of course, also for e-commerce, there's a huge market in e-commerce as well. But service- based businesses, local businesses where you have to make bookings, create appointments. I'll talk about that 
  
  **[00:16:00]**
  
  in a second. 
  
  Check service offerings, check prices, check discounts. And if you're just joining in, we're talking about voice AI receptionists and how they can help, specifically a an auto repair shop, for instance. It's a good example of where it can really help. So, one of the most common use cases that we see, and this will apply to most service- based businesses, most local service-based businesses for that matter, but it's very useful specifically for auto repair shops, is the booking. If someone calls in and they want to do an oil change or check their brakes or inflate their tires or replace their tires or balance their tires or align their car or truck, they might want to make an appointment so they don't have to go and wait in the shop for a long time. So an voice receptionist is very good at this because we can hook it up to a calendar. So the person can call in and then ask, "Oh, can I make an appointment for an oil change?" change. They say, "Sure, of course. What type of oil change do you want? Do you want synthetic? Do you want regular? Do you want what do you want?" And so maybe a synthetic blend. And they'll say, "Oh, yeah, for sure. I have this type of car. What do you recommend?" And maybe the agent can even recommend, "Oh, I suggest for your car the mileage you could do a synthetic blend." Or maybe it's a high-end car. And you're like, "No, no, no. Go go go premium all the way. Go full synthetic." And so that then the person, okay, how much is that? Okay, it's going to be $39, whatever that may be. Perfect. How long does it take? Well, 
  
  **[00:18:00]**
  
  it takes about 5 minutes or 10 minutes or I don't know, whatever that amount is to be. And then you can go ahead and tell them, "Well, I have availability for tomorrow 10:00 a.m. and 2 p.m. What works for you?" And then the person, the caller could just say, "Oh, yeah. 10 a.m. works." And then the thing will can go in and actually book the appointment in the shop's calendar and send a text message and send an email to the person or send a WhatsApp message and then it could also send a reminder the next day right before the appointment. And that allows you as a shop owner to keep track of your appointments, get a lot of appointments going because they can call after hours. If they know something happened at night, they call in, your office is closed, they have to leave a voicemail, somebody has to check that voicemail in the morning. Imagine different scenario where someone calls in 7 o'clock at night, 8 o'clock at night. They they had a flat tire. They they just replaced it with a spare. They call in, you get your agent. They say, "Sorry, it's after hours, but I can help you make an appointment for tomorrow first thing." And the person says, "Yes, it's sort of an emergency. I have to change the tire before I go on a trip." Say, "Okay, perfect. I can put an emergency slot right at the beginning, early in the morning. just come by and uh leave it up 7 am or whatever right before we open and we'll get you sorted out. So, it could do something like that and then and then that you'll get an email, a text, your your shop manager will get information 
  
  **[00:20:00]**
  
  about it as well, have it prioritized in this scenario and then the person can just get there in the morning and they know it's already in the system. They know they're already waiting for them and it all goes through smoothly and you didn't have to have someone doing after hours calling for you. What do some companies do if you're really busy? Well, they have to outsource the calls to a call center and that call center might not be even be in town. It might not even be in the country and then that's also a little bit of nuisance for for the clients. So, having someone that just speaks like they do in their language and understands everything they say because LLMs, as you probably experienced by now if you ever use Chachi PT or Gemini or anything like that, they're really good at understanding natural language. And so imagine this is just a voice layer on top of the LLM. It's basically it's the same LLM. It's like using chat GBT. It's just has a voice that we can use with a system like 11 Labs. It's just a provider that gives us a lot of voices. 
  
  And it can speak like I said at the beginning, it could speak happily. It could be mellow. It could be excited. It could have all sorts of different types of of um ways that it expresses itself and it can allow your customer to feel at ease knowing that that they're getting heard even if it's by an AI because it will it will repeat things to them if we prompt it that way. So you can have it actually clarify and repeat things and make sure that it's understanding what they're saying and asking them to 
  
  **[00:22:00]**
  
  say things like digitize if you're saying their number repeat it one by one and make sure that the name is being captured properly suggestions. It can provide suggestions. It can do all sorts of things and it's super useful very user friendly for your callers your customers because they're just calling. It's again it's just like a number but then the number that never gets tired and never gets frustrated and never is in a bad mood because having a bad day. It will always be as you program it to be. Now you can also have multiple agents. 
  
  So you can have an outgoing happy one and then if you detect a certain tone pattern from the customer, you can transfer to another one that's more calm and nurturing. If that's the case, you can match them to the right profile if you want. Nobody's doing that. And we can do that. And and it it could be that you know that your customers and this is not probably for an average person. This could be for another type of business, but if you have a very good profile on your customers, then you can have whoever answers the phone for them be someone that's uniquely aligned to that person. So if you know that person is calmer, more reserved, they might not want the AI, the the outgoing AI answering the number. Maybe they want someone a little more calm. And so they might have a yoga instructure type agent answer for them whenever they call and you can know who's calling via the number, right? So there's a ton of different configuration that we can do. And people don't know this. Like it's not just, hey, let me put up an agent. They all sound the 
  
  **[00:24:00]**
  
  same. 
  
  No, there's hundred thousands of voices out there that you can use. You can even clone voices. So if there's a specific voice that you really like, someone on your team that everyone loves, you can have it clone their voice so that then the agent talks like that person. If you want to, you can do that. And that's just the voice AI part of it. Like just the receptionist part of how you can use AI inside an auto repair shop. It's gamechanging. If you have a repair shop, if you have a nail salon, if you have a tattoo parlor, if you have a hair salon, anything like that. If you're taking calls right now to book appointments, you're you're losing out on potential calls because the f phone lines might be busy. You might be busy doing the actual service. If you're an electrician, you're a plumber. You're out there doing the service. You're missing calls. They're just going to your competitor. If you have a voice AI receptionist, it just handles it for you. Just go do the work and then you go to the next job and the next job and the check job. 
  
  And you can have your calendar all planned ahead for you for the next two weeks, three weeks if you want. It could have emergency protocols for people and then have it automatically message you so you call back. It could actually do an outbound call for you. If it realizes that there's some sort of emergency, it could triage it in a way where it it says, "Okay, thank you. We've got your information. We'll get back to you." And then immediately it can trigger a call back to them and say, "We've got someone on the line 
  
  **[00:26:00]**
  
  for you. 
  
  Give us a moment." And they'll call you. Then you can answer and then it'll connect you and you can talk to the person directly. Like there's there's no limits to the things you can do with these. It's really truly amazing what we can do nowadays. And it's not hard to set up in a business. We've set these up in a matter of days for some of these businesses. It's amazing. It's very useful. And I feel as a customer when I've ever seen it used as a customer when I call some place that has something like this, I like it. Just personally as a customer, I feel like I can get my questions answered quicker. I feel like I am getting to the root of the reason of my call faster. I feel that they are doing what they can or making an effort to make sure that me as a customer get a response quickly. So I I I see where people come from sometimes when they might not be very excited about the prospect of AI coming along and taking their job. I understand that. But I think it's more of an evolution. 
  
  I think it's it's using these tools to our advantage so that they can help our existing staff do a better job, an easier job. So I'll give you an example and this is this is something true story that that I heard from from one of our clients. We set up the AI receptionist and whenever they were talking to their front desk staff, the front desk staff was thrilled. They were not worried or scared. Once they saw it in action, they were very happy. Why? Because it meant a lot of those calls that shouldn't take 
  
  **[00:28:00]**
  
  up their time, frequently asked questions, checking prices, checking service offerings, checking hours, booking appointments, those a lot of those can go away and they can focus on some other work. And then something interesting that happens and this was told to me by a business owner. They say something very curious that happens is that while you're offloading some of the work for the frontend staff, it's actually creating more work for the backend staff. So if you have back office staff that supports delivery of your whatever your service is, you can imagine how that scales. So, while it might make the job easier from the front-end staff and you might not need to add two, three, four, five, six new front-end receptionists, which you might have not added anyway regardless of your scale, it is in fact generating a lot more back-end work because since you're getting so much more calls in, so much more booked appointments because they go with you instead of the competition. This means that now you're going to need more dentists behind the scenes, more doctors, you're going to need more plumbers. You're going to need more electricians. You're gonna need more mechanics because of all that works that's coming in and you're actually able to book and bill for. Now you need add more on the other side. And that's great. So it means actually that you're doing job creation, not taking jobs away. That's something I want to see. I don't know. I I want people to see it that way because that's what we've seen in reality in businesses and it's it's really really good. Now another part of this apart from the AI receptionist part that I've been talking about for the last 20 minutes, there's also the 
  
  **[00:30:00]**
  
  internal assistant. 
  
  And this is something we've built for business as well in all sorts of industries, but specifically now that we're talking about auto shops, how to repair shops. You can have a shop AI assistant. Now, envision this. You have your mechanics, maybe you're a mechanic yourself. You're working on a car and then you just need to know you're back there. You're about to put air into one of the tires. This is a very basic example, and it's happened to me before. You got the hose, got the air hose, got the tire, the car's already lifted up. 
  
  You go in, take off the little plug, and you're like, "Uh, I didn't check the pressure. Should it be 40? Should it be 33? Should it be 35? I'm not sure." So, your next point is going to be put this down, go over, maybe your hands are dirty. You got to get a rag, clean your hands, go over over the open the driver's side door, and look on the side and see what the air pressure should be for that specific car, for that specific tire. Now imagine you have this AI shop assistant where you're right there. 
  
  Same scenario. You got the car hanging there. You got the hose. You're like, "Oh, whatever. Shopppee." Think of it as an Alexa, right? You could have it where where your staff has a little microphone or something they could use or call in. You just say, "What's the recommended air pressure for a 2025 Honda Civic twodoor EX, whatever." And it'll say, "Oh, okay. It should be 35 all around. Okay, perfect. Or it should be 33 on the front and 34 on the back. Oh, perfect. And then it just you just go ahead continue. 
  
  
  
  **[00:32:00]**
  
  You didn't have to use rag to clean your hands. You didn't have to go and change whatever you were doing. Same goes for the oil. You're back there. You're ready. You're going to change it. You're going to change the oil filter. And then you're like, "Ah, how many liters did I need or or how much time we're going to spend here?" Because maybe you like you're going to take it off right now. Now you got your tool and then I I'm like, uh, should I then go over and do something else as soon as I get this pouring down or can I just wait for it because it's going to be quick. Well, if you ask it, oh, how many liters or gallons of oil does this car have? Specific again, Honda Civic 25 or whatever, you'll say, oh, yeah, yeah, it's, I don't know, x amount of gallons or x amount of liters. and it should take 10 minutes to drip down. Damn, I'm just making up numbers, right? And so, okay, perfect. So, then you know, you can take it off, leave it there, go do something else, and then come back instead of waiting for it. 
  
  But if it had told you, oh, it's two minutes or three minutes, then maybe you just stay there and do whatever other task you're there. Um, Armando. Okay, so on YouTube, we've got, "Hello, Armando. Excellent subject matter knowledge. I have a question for you. Do I need any special computer equipment to use this?" No, you do not actually. That's a great question. So when you want to set up something like a voice AI receptionist, the type of tools that we use are software as a service mostly. Like there's this tool called 
  
  **[00:34:00]**
  
  Vappy that you can use and anyone can use it really, but it obviously you want an expert if you want to do it more robust, but you can go ahead and create your own. Vapi allows you to create an agent, hook it up to a phone number um at a prompt, a system prompt where basically you tell the instructions and what it should answer with and sort of your hours and prices and packages and all that and then it'll work like you can just connect it to a phone and it'll just work. Now, if you want to connect it with additional tooling like, oh, I wanted to connect to my spreadsheets, I wanted to connect to my CRM, I wanted to connect to my shop system, etc., then yeah, that's when you want an expert like us to go in and actually make those connections for you. You can use a tool like N10 or whatever. We can connect everything for you so that it talks through different systems and it gets the right data and it gives it back. But for a basic basic system like pretty much anyone can do it which is really cool. 
  
  Now do you need any computer equipment? Well no because it runs on the cloud. So you put it up there you set it up and then it runs as your Gmail runs or any other service. It's just it's just a software that runs in the cloud and it talks to uh a specific phone number. Now depending on the country you're in this might be a little different. So in the United States for example, we have a lot of telephone providers and even Vappy, you can buy the phone number right there on their system. 
  
  
  
  **[00:36:00]**
  
  There's also Live Kit, there's there's retail, there's many different softwares that do this and and we can look into those as well, but you can typically always buy a number right there and just get it going. Now, many times what we do with customers is that they might already have a number, a trunk number that they have via um a virtual phone line. So a lot of the phone systems compared to how I've got before a long time ago you had phone systems and they were hardwired to your like there was a physical phone line going into your company. 
  
  Nowadays a lot of times you just have like a fiber optic cable coming in for your internet and that one also provides your phone lines. They're all virtual phone lines. They're they're trunk lines. And so if that's the case then you can have a virtual number that receives these calls. So it could be a number that goes into your PBX your answer your your phone system into your company and it will work just like a regular phone line or extension. So we have customers that use things like 8 by8 or other PBX systems and so it it allows us to either add an existing number connect it to something like Vappy for the voice assistant or we can create a number over here and then port it over transfer the calls over. And the great thing about all of this is that you always have a handoff possibility where the person can ask, "Oh, I need to talk with a human." And they'll just forward them directly to a human. There's no need to gatekeep or anything. You you want people to have an excellent customer experience. So, so if they 
  
  **[00:38:00]**
  
  want a handoff, you just give them the handoff, right? So, to your question again, you don't need any special computer equipment. It will just work. Now, if you wanted to go into specific like your specific phone number that you've had for 30 years, then yes, it's a matter of checking with your phone company, whoever provides that phone number. Is there a way to get that number to forward into um an IP system? Or maybe it's already an IP number and you can use it that way as well. talking about the shop AI assistant that I was talking about like, oh, I want to have a little agent within my company that I can talk to via voice, via WhatsApp, via like having a little microphone or whatever. Then there's many ways to approach that. I think the simplest one would be to just have like a phone um of sorts. Another way would have would be to have like tablets around the office and they just have like a button they could just tap or a Bluetooth a little microphone with a little button they could tap and it's like a Siri of sorts and it could connect directly to whatever system we build for this. But again it you don't necessarily need any computer equipment. It's just whatever interface you want to use. That's why I say a lot of times the simplest is just to use the phone. Many clients particularly in places like Mexico, India, they use WhatsApp a lot and WhatsApp has the ability to receive voice notes or voice calls as well. And so if you can connect an agent via WhatsApp both by text or by voice notes, it could be as easy as again the mechanic just just 
  
  **[00:40:00]**
  
  doing a voice note to this agent and saying whatever I just said like what's the tire pressure for this particular car or what's the oil filter I need to use for a 2025 Honda Civic. then it'll just it'll just give it the response back. We built some which are really fun that like it's a WhatsApp agent. You can talk to it via text, but then if you send it a voice note, since it knows you sent the voice note, it'll parse it. It'll understand it. It'll create the reply and it'll generate the voice and send it back, send you back a voice message because obviously if you sent it a voice message, you probably cannot read because you're maybe you're driving or or otherwise indisposed. then it'll just read it out to you so you can get it back. So many times you can be very creative on how you provide that interface for people. Um so yeah to answer your question, do you not need any special computer equipment to do any of this? Now you you probably want to integrated with your tools and that's where I was talking about the shop AI assistant. 
  
  So maybe you're doing the disc brakes, you want to check the specific thickness for a disc, right? You're right there. You have the calipers. you have everything and they're like h I don't have my sheet meet me or you dropped the sheet or something then you can ask it what's the specific thickness for this or just want to check to make sure and you can just it could go into a database there's these huge automotive industry databases and most of you if you're in the industry you already have access to these and there's ways 
  
  **[00:42:00]**
  
  to connect to them as well so you can connect to them get information about placement it could it could even again talking about like the WhatsApp version you could ask it something it get the diagram, show you the diagram so you can just look at it right there. You don't have to go to your boss and say, "Oh, can you give me the schematic for this Ford F-150 because the um exhaust has this issue, right? Or the throttle cable is loose and I need to rebuild it and I need the schematic." It could just query it, find it for you, and then send it back. As a mechanic, you just get it right there. You see it, zoom in, you're like, "Oh, perfect. This is how it goes." you do it or this is how much torque I need to apply to it. It could so there's the sky's is the limit. You could do so many things. Like here's here's an example that we're using for something else. We're using it for solar. But imagine you've got you've obviously got some fantastic mechanics that are working there long time, 20, 30 years. They know their stuff. 
  
  But then you have some new guys or girls and they might see a part component and and they're not sure about the damage, right? Maybe they see a rotor, maybe they see some bearings, they're looking at it and they're not quite sure. They think there might be something off, but they're not quite sure how to assess it yet. And everyone else is busy. So imagine your shop AI assistant allows you to take a picture of it. So they can just what? take a picture of it, send it, and then that thing can analyze 
  
  **[00:44:00]**
  
  it, parse the image, extract what's going on, and say, "Oh, I see some lateral damage on the second wall on the left. This looks like something that might have happened because of excessive temperature because they didn't change the oil, something like that." So, it could give it something like that, and then it'll be, "Oh, okay. Yeah, I was right or I was wrong or whatever." And now the person can can go in and do the next step. Or you could be proactive and say, "This part does not look like something that can be replaced. So, I suggest ordering this part for the customer because we know it has a lead time of 5 days. So, you better get that done soon. Do you want me to do it?" And then the person just say, "Yes, please." So, that could then trigger something going over to the shop's warehousing, whatever inventory, and then that person could say, "Oh, yeah, this makes sense." and then you could just approve it and then it goes out, the order gets placed and then in a few days that comes in. This also could be added to that person's car record with everything that's happening in that moment in time. So, as you can see, I'm just thinking of weird things that we could do that are all valid and all very, very possible. You could validate the amount of oil for things. You can even check the oil color and what that means. It can understand that for you. You could check inventory if I need an air filter, you could be walking around, you see, okay, I need an air filter. Um, do we have air filters for this whatever. So, instead of shouting out to the the 
  
  **[00:46:00]**
  
  the person in the shop, maybe they're busy, you just ask the thing and it be, oh yeah, and then you can have runners. You know how an Apple, if you ever gone to the Apple store, they have runners. So, somebody just puts something in there and then somebody comes out and gives you the thing. Well, you can have that. You can't just if you have a Vishy shop, you have runners that are coming in and out um of storage and and just getting parts that the mechanics need because they're just asking for them as they're working on the different vehicles or the different parts that could guide them on what's the next step on what they're doing to a vehicle to make sure they're checking off all the items in that work um order, right? They could do automatic reorder of inventory as well. Or, and this is something you'll love, if you have a shop yourself, if you're shop owner, you can have a status of your shop. So, you can have a basic agent that that you can just talk to it via text. You can just call it. Maybe you're out having dinner and you just just want to make sure that everything's running smoothly. You just call in to your agent and ask, "Okay, so how are we doing today?" And it'll give you a summary. It'll say, "Okay, so we've got base six, seven, and eight. They're done. We are two cars coming into base four and two. And it looks like we're going to clear the whole shop by the end of the day. Two cars are going to stay over because they were pending an approval or payment, whatever. And then uh we've got a full schedule for 
  
  **[00:48:00]**
  
  tomorrow. 
  
  The only blocker is that we need a refill on tank two for the oil, but the truck is already on its way. Should arrive tomorrow by midday. Right. So you could get that just in a call without talking to anyone really just check all your different systems and not bother your staff by micromanaging the thing can do it for you. So as you can see this is just a very basic example of what you can do in an auto repair shop. Who would have thought AI auto repair shop? It's not like but still right local business. 
  
  The same applies to any other local type service business. So, if you have a service business or even an an e-commerce business or you sell anything, think about how these tools can help you out because they truly can make a difference for your clients and make a difference for your employees to help them do their jobs better, to help them have their jobs be easier, to make less mistakes, to keep better logs of what's going on, and to just make it an overall better experience for everyone. clients, staff, owners. It's it's it's a good thing. 
  
  I think AI really is here to help us. It is a breakthrough. It is it is the next thing. We've talked about how the internet changed everything, how computers changed everything, how machines changed everything. Well, AI is going to change many things. Doesn't necessarily replace jobs. It will help a lot of jobs. It might take some jobs. Yeah, that's unfortunate. But it will make better jobs and it will instill the necessity for more jobs. So the same way the internet was a little complicated at the beginning because it replaced many things. Can you 
  
  **[00:50:00]**
  
  imagine how many jobs were created because of the internet? So everything that has happened since the Ardino came along wouldn't have been possible without the internet. So I think it's going to be something similar in that sense. But yeah, we'll see. In any case, I suggest you start reading up on this if you run any sort of business. There's so many things you could do to just make your job more efficient, make things more affordable, and make it an overall better experience for your customers as well.
